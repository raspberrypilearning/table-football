## Get the pitch ready for a game



+ Start a new project in Scratch.
+ Click on the **stage** next to the sprite and switch to the `Backdrops` tab, then click the `Upload backdrop from file` button and choose the **resources/pitch.jpg** file.
+ Delete the original blank backdrop, and the cat sprite.
+ Our goals need nets! Create a sprite using the `Upload sprite from file` button and select **resources/net.png**. Move the net into the middle of the goal on the left. Rename it **blue goal**.
+ Right-click on the net sprite and click `duplicate`, then move this new sprite to the goal on the right and rename it **red goal**.
